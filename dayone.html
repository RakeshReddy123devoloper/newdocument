Agriculture is both a cause of and sensitive to environmental degradation, such as biodiversity loss, desertification, soil degradation and climate change, which cause decreases in crop yield.[194] Agriculture is one of the most important drivers of environmental pressures, particularly habitat change, climate change, water use and toxic emissions.Agriculture is the main source of toxins released into the environment, including insecticides, especially those used on cotton. The 2011 UNEP Green Economy report stated that agricultural operations produced some 13 per cent of anthropogenic global greenhouse gas emissions. This includes gases from the use of inorganic fertilizers, agro-chemical pesticides, and herbicides, as well as fossil fuel-energy input.

Despite increases in agricultural production and productivity,[109] between 702 and 828 million people were affected by hunger in 2021.[110] Food insecurity and malnutrition can be the result of conflict, climate extremes and variability and economic swings.[109] It can also be caused by a country's structural characteristics such as income status and natural resource endowments as well as its political economy.</font size>
